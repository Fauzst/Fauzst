# About Me

Hi! I am currently a 2nd year Computer engineering student! I am exploring web development as of now, and I wanted to join the freelancing world as soon as possible. It's currently almost my 3rd month coding.
My skills are:
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-C++

I know there is still a lot of things I need to learn. And I will ensure that I will learn them one by one. I am following the front end map of roadmap.sh. While utilizing the free lessons of freeCodeCamp.
